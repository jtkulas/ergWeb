## About Us
We are a student-led consulting group within the Industrial/Organizational Psychology program at Montclair State University, founded in 2019. We look at ourselves as hard-working, driven students who wish to strengthen MSU's I/O Psych program, as well as learn outside of the classroom to build upon our skills and knowledge. We pride ourselves on strong involvement in local and national I/O groups, namely [METRO](https://metroapppsych.com/) and [SIOP](https://siop.org). For more information about the roles and responsibilities of Eagle I.O, please visit our [Consultant Manual](https://bookdown.org/kulasj/eagleiomanual/). 

## What We Do
We are responsible for executing various projects. Our main project is developing an Engagement survey, which we wish to distribute to external organizations. We also run a [mentorship program](https://bookdown.org/kulasj/mentorship/) within the MSU I/O program, where we train most of the 2nd year graduate students to guide the new students into becoming successful students themselves. Additionally, we host a variety of events, such as new student orientation, networking opportunities, and casual hangouts.
